# Humble-Superheroes


## How would I improve the code if I would've collaborated with a teammate:
1. Code Review & Feedback – Regularly review each other's work, suggest optimizations, and ensure best practices are followed.
2. Task Delegation – Split responsibilities based on strengths (one person handles core logic, another optimizes performance or adds tests).
3. Documentation & Testing – Work together to enhance documentation and expand test coverage to ensure reliability.

### If I had enough time I would make the following improvementes:
1. I would use React framework for the frontend.
2. Store the heroes in a databse instead of in-memory list.
3. Introduce power level (e.g., a numerical scale to measure their strength).
4. Allow sorting superheroes by multiple attributes (humility, power level, name).
5. Allow users to rate superheroes
6. Adding a Login/Regsiter feature
